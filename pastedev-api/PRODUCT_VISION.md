**Building a Secure Paste Service with Flexible Access Controls**

I'm developing a paste service that allows users to easily upload text snippets from any environment—whether through a web browser, terminal, or Docker containers—with minimal configuration required.

The core challenge is balancing ease of use with content moderation. Hosting user-generated content carries legal risks when prohibited material is uploaded, something I've unfortunately experienced firsthand.

**Proposed Solution Architecture:**

To address this, I've designed a tiered access system:

**Anonymous/Quick Sharing:**
- Upload snippets instantly via web or CLI without authentication
- Snippets are automatically deleted after first access (one-time view)
- Content is preserved locally in the browser's localStorage after viewing
- Perfect for quickly sharing logs, configs, or temporary data

**Registered Users (with permanent storage):**
- New users must be approved by an admin after registration
- Once approved, users can create unlimited permanent snippets
- Provides accountability through verified user accounts

This approach maintains the frictionless experience that developers expect when quickly sharing a log file from a terminal or passing along configuration snippets, while implementing safeguards against problematic content. The one-time view mechanism for anonymous uploads significantly reduces liability exposure, as content doesn't persist on the server.

By requiring admin approval for user accounts rather than individual snippets, the system scales better while still maintaining control—trusted users can work freely while the platform remains protected from abuse. This represents a practical compromise: anonymous users and CLI tools retain simple, fast access for temporary sharing, while approved users gain the ability to create permanent snippets without friction.
